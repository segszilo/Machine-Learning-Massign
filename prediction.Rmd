Practical Machine Learning Assignment
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document describing the procedure useed in prediction for the assignment for the Practical Machine Learning Course. The following sections therefore present how the analysis is caried.

To start the analysis, the caret package is loaded in;
```{r}
library(caret)
```

To load in the datasets, i.e. the traning and testing datasets;
```{r}
training <- read.csv("C:/Users/Zilon/Downloads/pml-training.csv")
summary(training)
testing <- read.csv("C:/Users/Zilon/Downloads/pml-testing.csv")
summary(testing)
```

A variety of plots are plotted to view the data in charts. 
Firstly, the feature plot of all the features of the training data;
```{r}
featurePlot(x=training[,c("roll_belt", "pitch_belt", "total_accel_belt")],
            y = training$raw_timestamp_part_2,
            plot="pairs")
```

Also, a qplot of the training data is carried out.
```{r}
qq <- qplot(roll_belt, pitch_belt, colour=total_accel_belt,data=training)
qq + geom_smooth(method='lm', formula=y~x)
```
Then, a qplot with colour differentiation is carried out.
```{r}
qplot(roll_belt, colour=pitch_belt, data=training, geom="density")
```

The prediction algorithm is as follows:
```{r}
modelFit <- train(raw_timestamp_part_2 ~., data=training, method="glm")
```

```{r}
modelFit
modelFit$finalModel
```

```{r}
predictions <- predict(modelFit,newdata=testing)
predictions
```

```{r}
confusionMatrix(predictions, testing$raw_timestamp_part_2)
```
